Understanding the SCARF partitions
##################################

As SCARF has grown over the years it has evolved into a heterogeneous cluster and not a single multi-node machine. As a result, in order to get the best results, it is important to review the resources available on it and to understand how the partitions give access to different parts of the cluster. The scarf partition is the default partition, other partitions can be selected using the -p option to srun and sbatch.
