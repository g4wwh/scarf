Browsing your SCARF home and work directory from your desktop or laptop
#######################################################################

SCARF runs a SAMBA server to make it easier for users to upload and download files between SCARF and their desktop or laptop.

As this service relies on the STFC authentication system, this service is only available to users with an STFC or Diamond federal id and from systems that are inside the STFC or Diamnd firewall or are connected to STFC via the VPN.

Note that deleting files in your SCARF account or work areas via this method will delete them permanently, the files will not be recoverable via the Recycle Bin or Trash Folder.
