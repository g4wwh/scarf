SCARF Configuration
*******************

The hardware for SCARF is purchased on a yearly basis, with each new addition added to the same set of computational job queues so as to give the users a seamless experience. This has the advantage of meaning that no large outlay of money is needed in a single year, as well as enabling us to get the best quality hardware for our money on each occasion.

The original cluster was a 256 core, 128 node cluster purchased in 2004, which has since been retired from service and completely replaced with the incremental expansions listed below.
