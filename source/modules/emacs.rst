**Description for emacs:**

GNU Emacs is an extensible, customizable text editorâ€”and more. At its core is an interpreter for Emacs Lisp, a dialect of the Lisp programming language with extensions to support text editing. The features of GNU Emacs include:

* Content-sensitive editing modes, including syntax coloring, for a variety of file types including plain text, source code, and HTML.
* Full Unicode support for nearly all human languages and their scripts.
Highly customizable, using Emacs Lisp code or a graphical interface.


**Using emacs:**

Load the module, then run emacs to start. If you are using X-forwarding then it will open a new window, otherwise it will use your existing window.
