Applications and Libraries
##########################

SCARF supports a diverse range of software applications. Others can be installed according to license conditions and user demand. Please let us know if there is anything you'd like to see.

Here are the up-to-date lists of Applications and Libraries available on SCARF. Please click on the links to view the relevant documentation.

The first list is built automatically from the modules available on the cluster. The second is for other significant pieces of software which are not accessed via the module system - this is typically software that is installed with the operating system and has not been compiled by the SCARF admin team.
